# Road Segmentation with Convolutional Neural Networks
##### Th√©o Deprelle, Valentin Nigolian, Niccolo Sacchi
This project is part of the course "Pattern Classification and Machine Learning" taught at EPFL in 2017. It presents a technique for segmenting satellite images by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN we used implements classify each pixel either as road or background, but can be adapted to detect any kind of feature depending on the provided ground-truth.

Our team obtained an F1 score of 93.38% on the test set. The model and the techniques used are explained in `groupRoadSegmentationFault-submission.pdf`.

You should change the path of the images in the run.py and train.py files. All the images we have used are zipped in the folder.

### Libraries
In order to correctly to run the scripts the following libraries must be installed:

- torch 0.2.0_4
- numpy,scipy

### Hardware
The model has been trained on a GPU acceleration, with the following setup:

- NVIDIA Titan X (with 12 GB of RAM)
- python 3.6.4
- Cudnn 8.0

### How to reproduce the predictions
To generate the predictions, it is only necessary to run the script `run.py`. It won't train the model, instead it load the weights from `weights.h5`. Notice that this script expect to fin the test image in the folder `dataset/test_set_images`.

### How to train
To train the model from scratch run instead `train.py`. With our configuration the training took 3 hours on the gpu.
